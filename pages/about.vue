      <p>
          Hello, I'm Jon and my passion is building great user-centric systems.
      </p>
      <p>
          I've been lucky enough to be involved in the web since the early challenges of analogue modems, ubiqutious on-premise infrastructure and pre-CSS.<br>We've overcome those challenges, to emerge with distributed systems that are more robust and cheaper to maintain and scale.
      </p>
      <p>As an end-to-end developer, I am able to help your organisation by observing Howapped's three principal values:</p>

            </ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Ensure Quality</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding automated testing for greater confidence that quality is delivered, on-budget and on-schedule</li>
            </ul>

      </ul>
