      <p>
          Hello, I'm Jon and building great user-focused systems is my passion.
      </p>
      <p>
          I've been lucky enough to be involved in the web since the early challenges of analogue modems, ubiqutious on-premise infrastructure and pre-CSS and we've overcome those challenges, to emerge with distributed systems that are more robust and cheaper to maintain and scale.
      </p>
      <p>As an end-to-end developer, I am able to help your organisation by observing Howapped's three principal features:</p>
      
      <br />

      <ul>
        <li>Full-stack Web development</li>
        <li>Quality</li>
        <li>Productivity</li>
      </ul>

      <br />
      <h4 class="title is-4">Building to last</h4>

      <p>As a software generalist, I've seen technologies come and go, thrive and flourish and I'm dedicated to architecting with the most appropriate stack for the job.</p>
